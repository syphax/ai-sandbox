1. Build a skill for OpenClow to interact with Claude Code

I have OpenClaw installed on my machine. I want to build a skill for it to interact with Claude Code. 

Primary use case: 

I want to be able to tell my OpenClaw agent(s) to tell Claude Code to build scripts. Essentially so that Claude Code acts as a sub-agent or tool available to OpenClow. OpenClaw will be able to send commands, and and receive status updates, clarifying questions, etc.

I want to be able to do this without having to use the Claude Code web interface. I want to be able to do this from the command line, and have OpenClaw interact with Claude Code in a way that feels natural and integrated.

I want to be able to do this in a way that is secure and private. I don't want to have to expose any of my data to the internet (beyond what must be sent to Claude). I want to be able to do this all locally on my machine.

I want to be able to do this in a way that is extensible. I want to be able to add more skills to OpenClaw in the future, and have them interact with other tools in a similar way.

I want to be able to do this in a way that is efficient. I want to be able to have OpenClaw and Claude Code interact in a way that is fast and responsive.

I want to be able to do this in a way that is reliable. I want to be able to have OpenClaw and Claude Code interact in a way that is stable and predictable.

I want to be able to do this in a way that is maintainable. I want to be able to have OpenClaw and Claude Code interact in a way that is easy to maintain over time.

If necessary, please ask me any clariying questions.

I am using OpenClaw 2026.2.6-3. Skills are stored in ~/.openclaw/skills.
