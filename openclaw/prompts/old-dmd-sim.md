1. Build a synthetic demand generator

I want to build in synthetic demand generator. 

The inputs are demand by geography and demand by part. 

The geography is demand by Zip 3. The columns of the input file are:
- Zip3 area code (may be zero padded, or may be integers)
- Demand

The units of demand could be people, units, $, anything. Regardless, we want to compute the normalized percent of this demand for each ZIP3 area, such as the total of this new field Demand_Pct = 1.0

The demand by part is contained in a different file.

This file has 3 required fields (but may have others, as well):
- Part Number (alphanumeric)
- Qty (Annualized Sales or Demand in Units)
- Sales (Annualized Sales or Demand in Dollars)

There can be 100,000s or even millions of part numbers.

hat I want to do is create synthetic orders.

We will need to come up with synthetic profiles for:
- overall demand by month
- overall demand by day of the week-
- overall demand by hour

Eventually, we will want to be able to deal with coupled factors, like demand for certain part numbers can vary by season and can vary by geography. But for now, the time-varying profiles are independent of geography and part number.

The synthetic orders will be generated by:
- Selecting a random part number, weighted by the demand by part
- Selecting a random ZIP3 area code, weighted by the demand by geography
- Selecting a random date and time, weighted by the time-varying profiles

The output file will have the following fields:
- Part Number
- ZIP3 area code
- Date and Time
- Quantity
- Sales

The quantity and sales will be computed by:
- Quantity = Qty * Demand_Pct
- Sales = Sales * Demand_Pct

The Demand_Pct is the normalized demand for the ZIP3 area code.

The output file will be a CSV file.

Understood. I have integrated "Lumpy Demand" and other advanced behaviors into a **Phase 2: Advanced Modeling Capabilities** section. This keeps the initial requirements document focused and actionable while providing a roadmap for future complexity.
